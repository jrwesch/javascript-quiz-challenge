# javascript-quiz-challenge

Deadline - Dec 19, 2022

Description
We were given the task of creating a small multiple-question quiz like one we may see in interviews someday. The quiz is timed and will store user scores with given intials. The given user story was:

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

The acceptance criteria were:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
