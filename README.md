# Deadline - Dec 19, 2022

# Description
We were given the task of creating a small multiple-question quiz like one we may see in interviews someday. The quiz is timed and will store user scores with given intials. The given user story was:

AS A coding boot camp student</br>
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores</br>
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers</br>
</br>
The acceptance criteria were:</br>
</br>
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz</br>
WHEN I click the start button</br>
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question</br>
WHEN I answer a question</br>
THEN I am presented with another question</br>
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly</br>
THEN time is subtracted from the clock</br>
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0</br>
THEN the game is over</br>
WHEN the game is over</br>
THEN I can save my initials and my score</br>
